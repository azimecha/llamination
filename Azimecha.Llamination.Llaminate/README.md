# Azimecha.Llamination.Llaminate

This program gives access to a language model using the classic console-based prompt interface, just like llama.cpp's example program.

Provide the path to a model file as a command line argument. The program will wait for the model to load, then it will show the prompt character `> ` and you can start chatting.
