# Azimecha.Llamination.DeepSpeech

This project adds support for DeepSpeech, a fast but low quality speech recognition engine.

Using it requires the DeepSpeech model and native library from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases). First download "deepspeech-*x*.*x*.*x*.pbmm" and "deepspeech-*x*.*x*.*x*.tflite", then scroll down to "Assets", click "Show all 99 assets", and download the "native_client" for your target CPU and OS.
